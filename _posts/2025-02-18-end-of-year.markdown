Hi folks! A bit late to the game here, but I thought it would be nice to do a bit of reflection on 2024. 2024 saw a bunch of fun changes in Wandrer, highlights of which include:

* A brand [new map](https://wandrer.earth/dashboard/my_places) that looks better, is faster and nicer to navigate, fixed a lot of interface quirks with the previous maps, and also makes it a lot easier to add new features.

* Added the first routing features for Wandrer, with these rolling out more widely to upgraded users in February.
* Added support for syncing activities from RideWithGPS and Garmin (Garmin is currently for upgraded folks only). More services coming!
* 9,956,804 activities processed in 2024
* 30,924,894 new miles / 49,768,792 new km covered in 2024
* 30,707 new places added to Wandrer in 2024
* At the beginning of 2024, Wandrers had been to every country but 2: Eritrea and Equatorial Guinea. Eritrea has now been visited, so there's only one left! You have your marching orders.
* 100,000 active Wandrers!
* 5 OpenStreetMap map updates
* Lots of [nice](https://escapecollective.com/the-silly-online-cycling-battle-that-became-so-much-more/) [stories](https://old.reddit.com/r/wandrer/comments/1d76r8l/50_done_toronto/) [about](https://old.reddit.com/r/wandrer/comments/1cwyegj/just_100ed_my_first_town_starting_small/) [people](https://www.strava.com/clubs/528504/posts/33592491) [going](https://theradavist.com/riding-every-street-in-london/) [places](https://www.strava.com/clubs/528504/posts/32024459) [they've](https://www.gofundme.com/f/everydeadendLA) [never](https://www.strava.com/clubs/528504/posts/31727741) [been](https://old.reddit.com/r/wandrer/comments/1dfgu0r/appreciation_post_i_suffered_a_brain_injury_a_few/) [before](https://old.reddit.com/r/wandrer/comments/1ewptka/if_im_not_mistaken_jan_is_the_only_person_to_have/).
* We have collectively traveled *26%* of the entire planet, or 12187981 miles / 19614654 km!.

All of this would not be possible without **your** support, so **thank you so much**. Wandrer is such a fun weird thing, and I'm glad that yall like it enough to let me keep working on it.

Your end-of-year stats should be available on your [dashboard](https://wandrer.earth/dashboard) as well, so keep an eye out for those!
