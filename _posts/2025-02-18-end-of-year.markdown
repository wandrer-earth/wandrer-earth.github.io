Hi folks! A bit late to the game here, but I thought it would be nice to do a bit of reflection on 2024. 2024 saw a bunch of fun changes in Wandrer, highlights of which include:

* A brand [new map](https://wandrer.earth/dashboard/my_places) that looks better, is faster and nicer to navigate, fixed a lot of interface quirks with the previous maps, and also makes it a lot easier to add new features.

* Added the first routing features for Wandrer, with these rolling out more widely to upgraded users in February.
* Added support for syncing activities from RideWithGPS and Garmin (Garmin is currently for upgraded folks only). More services coming!
* 9,956,804 activities processed in 2024
* 30,924,894 new miles / 49,768,792 new km covered in 2024
* 30,707 new places added to Wandrer in 2024
* At the beginning of 2024, Wandrers had been two every country but 2: Eritrea and Equatorial Guinea. Eritrea has now been visited, so there's only one left! You have your marching orders.
* 5 OpenStreetMap map updates
* We have collectively traveled *26%* of the entire planet, or 12187981 miles / 19614654 km!.

All of this would not be possible without **your** support, so **thank you so much**. Wandrer is such a fun weird thing, and I'm glad that yall like it enough to let me keep working on it.

Your end-of-year stats should be available on your [dashboard](https://wandrer.earth/dashboard) as well, so keep an eye out for those!
