Our friends at [Kentucky Cycling](https://www.kentuckycycling.org/home) invited Craig to chat about Wandrer in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2ysUreY-3g). Nathan and Craig discussed the origins of Wandrer, the details of the data and how the game works, as well as personal details like how Craig got into cycling and how many bikes he owns (an ever changing number).

They also take a look at the Kentucky leaderboard and marvel at the leader's map, in addition to discussing some of the fun side benefits of looking at maps all day.
