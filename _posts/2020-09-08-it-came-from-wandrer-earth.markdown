Craig and I thoroughly enjoyed watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lmqo-sdjHFk) from [OPE! Cycling](https://www.opecycling.com/) showing an attempt to ride a century on city streets without backtracking while maximizing new roads. There are so many classic Wandrer-ing moments captured here -- unexpected no trespassing signs, climbing over fences, paths that are on the map but disappear into a huge pile of weeds, dead ends at a river.

This video is super inspiring (we'd like to host an event to attempt a similar ride on Atlanta's streets) and great fun to watch. Thanks for the feature, Ope!
