We enjoyed reading about Aaron Chamberlain's journey around Texas in Texas Monthly. You can read details about each week: [1](https://www.texasmonthly.com/travel/tour-de-texas-why-im-cycling-3000-mile-perimeter/), [2](https://www.texasmonthly.com/travel/tour-de-texas-week-2-riding-behind-pine-curtain/), [3](https://www.texasmonthly.com/travel/tour-de-texas-week-3-riding-the-northeast-texas-trail-relishing-local-beers/), [4](https://www.texasmonthly.com/travel/tour-de-texas-week-4-battling-high-winds-and-exhaustion-panhandle/), [5](https://www.texasmonthly.com/travel/tour-de-texas-week-5-getting-by-with-a-little-help-from-my-friends/), [6](https://www.texasmonthly.com/travel/tour-de-texas-week-6-underrated-beauty-guadalupe-mountains/), [7](https://www.texasmonthly.com/travel/tour-de-texas-week-7-tough-climbs-and-spectacular-views-west-texas/), and [8](https://www.texasmonthly.com/travel/tour-de-texas-journeys-end/). It's inspiring to read how adventures can be found close to home. Reading such a detailed ride report is a good reminder that these adventures aren't always easy either, with unexpected hills, wind, physical discomfort and the mental funks brought about by such challenges.

Speaking of close to home, Aaron has also cycled every road in Austin TX (as covered by [Texas Highways](https://texashighways.com/travel-news/4900-miles-later-this-cyclist-has-biked-every-single-street-in-austin/)), resulting in an impressive map -- so dense with ridden roads that you can barely read the "Austin" label on the map! Cheers, Aaron, keep riding!
