Wandrer now supports multiple languages! Pearl recently finished improving our support for French and added in German, Spanish, and Italian. To update your Wandrer account to a different language, head to your "Settings" page and select the "Locale" dropdown. We don't yet have 100% of all text on the site translated. Please let us know if you notice a translation that is confusing or inaccurate and we'll try to fix any issues.
