DC Rainmaker published quite an extensive "Quick App Review" about Wandrer, which is available on the [DC Rainmaker site](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2020/12/quick-app-reviews-wandrer-tracks-your-quest-to-ride-every-road.html). It's always satisfying when the features that we read that Wandrers want (runs/walks in addition to bike rides, routing options, a native app for the phone) are the same features that we're working hard to develop. Thanks for the write-up, DC Rainmaker and keep exploring!
