I'm so grateful to have the opportunity to work with my husband Craig on Wandrer. We try to infuse a spirit of exploration and adventure into our life and the app grows out of our life. That said, there are times when working on Wandrer can be overwhelming: our to-do lists only grow and there are inevitably technical hiccups that are frustrating to fix and a bit discouraging.

For this reason, we always love discovering blog posts like [this one](https://www.169k.net/blog/Wandrer) from the [169k.net](https://www.169k.net/) blog where Martin shares how he's rediscovered the world using Wandrer (we read it using Google Translate since we don't speak German). It's super inspiring for us here at Wandrer Worldwide HQ, nudging us to remember why love to use Wandrer ourselves and to push through the technical difficulties!
