[Erik](https://truemarmalade.com/) is cycling every road in Tucson, Arizona (all 3280 miles of them), trying (without much trouble it seems) to collect 10,000 aluminum cans along the way, and discovering adventure and new places close to home. Once the 10,000 cans are collected, the plan is to melt/process them in to a functional piece of art, (like a bike rack). Lots more info [here](https://truemarmalade.com/culdesac) and [here](https://truemarmalade.com/tenthousandcans) and definitely worth a follow on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/truemarmalade/) / [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/truemarmalade/). Prepare to see lots of cans and lots of ridiculous giant trucks.
