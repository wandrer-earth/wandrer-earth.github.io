The Berkeleyside wrote an article about Wandrer user Bryan Bischof's [quest to walk every street in Berkeley](https://www.berkeleyside.org/2023/01/22/walk-all-the-streets-in-berkeley-bryan-bischof) (approximately 288 unique miles / 463 unique km). Attempting to reach 100% is essentially impossible and maintaining > 99% requires dedication (new roads can be added with an update, making the 99% achievement frustratingly fleeting). As Bryan describes it though, that is "the futility of perfection". If you see someone walking an adorable dog named Ravioli (:swoon:) in the Berkeley area, it's probably Bryan! Good luck getting back above 99%.
