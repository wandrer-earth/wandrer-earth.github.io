Jon describes his adventures riding > 90% of the roads in his hometown of Wigan, UK on the [Wet, cold, and angry](https://samuriinbred.wordpress.com/2021/12/19/end-of-a-wandrer-era/) blog. This description is an entertaining read for those of us who live in an area with many Low Traffic Neighborhoods (extensive cul-de-sac neighborhoods) and have attempted to systematically ride a significant portion of said neighborhoods. Deeply learning about your city isn't always roses and cherry pies -- there's bad (or nonexistent) cycling infrastructure and depressingly poorly maintained neighborhoods (we've observed both of these in Atlanta, too). Jon points out some of the good consequences to this type of completionist exploring, such as knowing the best route from any given points A to B. A highly recommended read and congrats, Jon, on your Wandrering accomplishment.
