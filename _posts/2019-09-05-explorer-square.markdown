Read about how Wandrer compares to the experience of VeloViewer tiling over on the [Explorer Square](https://explorersquare.wordpress.com/2019/09/05/wandrer-earth/) blog. One thing that stood out to me is how our perception of riding "everywhere" can change depending on how you look at the map -- do you include dirt roads? What about dead ends? Dead ends can be tedious to ride, but also rewarding to explore (we've found neighborhood gathering spots, unknown community gardens, unexpected paths to other streets, huge piles of abandoned tires, etc.). No matter what motivates you to explore (tiling or completing every road), I hope you find reasons to keep getting out there.
