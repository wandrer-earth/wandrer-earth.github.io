Hello hello. As an additional follow-up to [this post](https://news.wandrer.earth/2024/12/09/strava-wandrer-changes.html), Wandrer can now be used with Coros! You can link your Coros account at your [Wandrer settings page](https://wandrer.earth/settings#linked).

At the moment, Wandrer will only download at most 10 years of your Coros history, since there isn't currently a way for Wandrer to know how many activities you have. I think 10 years might be older than Coros the company though, so hopefully that's enough for you.
