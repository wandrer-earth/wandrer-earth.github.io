Another month has flown by, very quickly as our time has been divided between working on Wandrer, finishing our bike tour in Taiwan, and taking care of our sweet little growing baby. So what have we been up to at Wandrer?

### New Activities Page Design
I finished an update to the design of the Activities overview page and the detailed individual Activity page. We hope that the new design makes for a more pleasant and intuitive experience as you interact with the site. As part of the new Activity page, there is now a tooltip to show you the total length of your activity and how much of the activity's GPS trace matched to a road in Wandrer's map. This feature should help you recognize if the OpenStreetMap data needs to be updated in the area surrounding your activity. To view this data, hover your cursor over your New Miles. If you find this feature useful and want the total length and matched length to be featured more prominently on your activity page, please do [reach out](mailto:pearl@wandrer.earth) and let us know! We are always curious to hear what data is of interest.

### Toggle unpaved roads visibility on your map
I also added a feature to the map that lets you choose if you want to view your Untraveled roads that are unpaved. If you prefer that your map not show unpaved roads when you load it, you can change your default map view in the Preferences section of the Settings page.

### We've added long distance trails
We now have several long distance trails in Wandrer as Achievements: the Trans Canada Trail, Bay Area Ridge Trail, San Francisco Bay Trail, Pacific Crest Trail and Appalachian Trail. These are available as Explorer Achievements on the dashboard for the containing region.

### Craig's updated so many map regions
In the last month, Craig has updated 337 map regions. As of 28 February, there are 377 pending map update requests. If you've placed a request and are still waiting, we're sorry about that! At the moment, it does take time for our servers to make the new map data and update the activities in the region. You may also notice some discrepancies between your activities, statistics, and map data while your data converts to the new map. It's quite challening to keep everything in sync! As you may gather, at our current pace (337 completed / 377 pending) this update system won't work. But never fear, Craig has been hard at work on a new update system that should be faster and easier for us to maintain.

### Super Unique Distance View is in Progress
We hoped to have this feature ready to share by the end of this month but didn't quite get there. We are now populating the data for viewing your "Super Unique" distance on a map and checking to make sure the data are accurately updated when activities are processed and updated to new map data. Super Unique roads are ones that you have traveled that no other Wandrer has completed (you can see your Super Unique distance for 2022 in your [Yearly Summary](https://wandrer.earth/history/2022)).

### We're Getting Patches
I am delighted to report that we have iron-on patches in production! The samples look charming. We will sell these patches as another way to support Wandrer and adorn your gear. Look for prices and more details in late March / early April.

### Finished our Taiwan tour and heading home
As I mentioned at the beginning of this update, we've finished our bike tour of Taiwan. In the end, we rode 1270.7 unique km / 789.6 unique mi / 1.23% of the country. We explored many small country roads, our baby was adopted by a kind and generous pair of grandparents, and we ate a ton of delicious food. The baby also experienced many firsts during the last month - sitting up, eating, and getting very close to crawling. It's been a wonderful trip and we're both a little sad to see it end even as we're excited to return home to friends and family.
