Nathan from [Kentucky Cycling](https://www.kentuckycycling.org/home) invited a group of the top Kentucky Wandrers to gather and discuss their exploration of the state.

Craig and I very much enjoyed seeing the maps for each of these Kentucky Wandrers and hearing about the tight monthly challenge competitions (which include sometimes taking advantage when one competitor is out of town). Thanks to Nathan for organizing and all the Kentucky Wandrers who participated!
